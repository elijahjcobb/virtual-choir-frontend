					<h2>A NOTE FROM JEFFREY COBB:</h2>
					<p>Greetings everyone! I hope this finds you well, and healthy!</p>
					<p>In these times of self-quarantining and social distancing, we need to find a way to connect. What better
						way to do that than through music? I wish we could all be together, and make music in person, but...
						since we canâ€™t right now, how about connecting virtually?</p>
					<p>I would love to have you be a part of our inaugural NMC Virtual Choir. My goal is to have 100 people
						participate! (Please help spread the word to other folks connected to NMC.)</p>
					<p>The DEADLINE for submissions is <b>Thursday, April 9, at 5:00pm</b>. I hope to finish mixing and editing the
						video, and release it to the public by Monday, April 20.</p>
					<p>Thank you for lending your time and talents to this project!</p>
					<p>All my best...<br/>Jeff</p>
